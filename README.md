## TODO APP CLI IN GO

This is a sample CLI written in Go. I wrote this to get familiar with Go and building a CLI in general. My next project will also be a CLI in Go but a tad more complex :p

Commands are list, add, delete and done.
List can accept sort ('earliest' or 'latest') as well as a bool done parameter to filter by done.

### To run : go run main.go
### To build : go build
